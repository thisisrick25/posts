Git applies settings from your `~/.gitconfig` to every repository. This is useful for defaults but becomes a problem when repositories or remotes need different identities or settings, for example:

1. Different user identities or signing keys for different remotes (github, gitlab, bitbucket).
2. Frequently switching between private and public remotes, which forces manual overrides.
3. Managing multiple SSH keys and per-host commit signing.

These situations often require editing or overriding your global config â€” the rest of this post shows how to scope settings to specific hosts and repos.

How it works
- Use `~/.ssh/config` to select the right SSH key per host.
- Use Git's `includeIf` to load host-specific `.gitconfig` only when a repository uses that remote.
- Configure commit signing per host and register allowed signers on the server.

> I am using different SSH keys for authentication and signing commits for GitHub and GitLab. You can use the same key for both, but using separate keys is more secure.

## multiple git host with different ssh auth and sign key

To manage multiple git hosts (like GitHub, GitLab) with different SSH keys, 

1. Create a SSH config file at `~/.ssh/config`

```shell title="C://Users/username/.ssh/config"
# github
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github_auth
    IdentitiesOnly yes

# gitlab
Host gitlab.com
    HostName gitlab.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_gitlab_auth
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

```shell title="C://Users/username/.gitconfig"
[user]
	name = thisisrick25
	email = swapnaneel06@gmail.com
	signingkey = C:\\Users\\username\\.ssh\\id_ed25519_github_sign.pub
[filter "lfs"]
	clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
	smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
	process = git-lfs filter-process
	required = true
[gpg]
	format = ssh
[gpg "ssh"]
	allowedSignersFile = ~/.ssh/allowed_github_signers
[commit]
	gpgsign = true
[includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:*gitlab.com*/**"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-gitlab
[includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:https://gitlab.com/**"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-gitlab
```

```shell title="C://Users/username/.gitconfig-gitlab"
[user]
	signingkey = C:\\Users\\username\\.ssh\\id_ed25519_gitlab_sign.pub
[gpg "ssh"]
	allowedSignersFile = ~/.ssh/allowed_gitlab_signers
```
